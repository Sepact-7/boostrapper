To use Sepact executor, you must first open the requirement.py file to install all the necessary modules.

Then you can open Sepact.exe, which will be a future executor.

For now, this is just an interface where you can enter a key, but it won't lead to anything; it's just for testing the key system.

This will be updated soon.
